Imagine you are going to a blood donation. For security reasons a blood probe
for every participant is checked for Hepatitis B. The control of your probe using
a standard Hepatitis B test gives back a positive result.
A standard Hepatitis B test is 99.7% sensitive and 99.5% specific. Thus it gives
back a positive result with a probability of 99.7% for infected persons and a
negative result with a probability of 99.5% for non-infected persons. About
0.2% of the German population is infected by Hepatitis B. State the Bayes’
Theorem and name all parts (Likelihood, posterior, prior) properly! Give an
example why the Bayes’ Theorem is useful for robotic applications! Calculate
the probability that you are really infected with Hepatitis B using the Bayes’
Theorem!

You are in a casino and observe a player who always bets on the number 13 by
Roulette. In 5 games he won 3 times. You suspect that the player cheats. Please
use the Bayesian View to either verify or disprove your suspicion. We thereby
assume the prior probability density distribution to be uniformly distributed
over the interval [0,1]. As trust interval we use [0,

37 ].
Hint: The probability of winning by betting on the number 13 is p13 =

Below you find a sketch of a Gaussian Process estimating the amount of oil
(y= y(x)) based on the measured values marked by a dot. The aim was to
estimate the amount of oil for all positions xby drawing the mean (dotted line)
and the variance (solid lines). Also, the next drilling point for searching for a
maximum should be drawn. However, some mistakes have crept in. Please mark
the mistakes in the sketch (do not use red) and shortly explain each mistake in
the box below.

Mark the correct statements about GPs and GPs with built-in GMRFs. Note
you can get +1 point for a correct answer and−1 point for a wrong choice. The
minimum is zero points.
⃝The computational time of GPs is always less than the computational
time of GPs with built-in GMRFs
⃝GPs require a definition of a regular grid, the so called generating
points
⃝The covariance matrix K used for GPs has to be positive definite
⃝GPs are linear regression models which can be used for modeling the
dynamics of robotics systems
⃝Let xi,yi for i = 1,...,n the training data for the GPs, then Kij=
kernel(xi,xj) defines a required covariance matrix if kernel is a valid
kernel function
⃝The hyper-parameters for GPs with built-in GMRFs can be learned
using the Log-Likelihood method
⃝The covariance matrix Kfor GPs has to be strictly diagonal dominant
with Kii >0, ∀i.
⃝GPs with built-in GMRFs have the computational complexity of O(NM2),
where M is the number of generating points and N the number of mea-
surements
⃝Gaussian processes are stochastic processes
⃝GPs have the computational complexity of O(N4), where N is the
number of measurements

We computed for x∈[0,5] the covariance function of a Gaussian Process using
the four diﬀerent Kernels:
k1(x1,x2) = exp−
k2(x1,x2) = 10·exp−
k3(x1,x2) = x⊤
1 x2 + 2 ,
k4(x1,x2) = exp (−|x1−x2|),
We then sampled a set of 10 diﬀerent latent functions f according to the Gaus-
sian process prior:
f ∼N(0,K),
for all four diﬀerent Kernel/Covariance Matrices and plotted them. Please al-
locate the kernel functions to the correct plots by writing k1,...,k4 above the
plots.

Probabilistic Inference
4. (25 Points)
(a)••(8 Points)
Mark the correct statements about probabilistic time series models (PTSM).
Note you can get +1 point for a correct answer and−1 point for a wrong choice.
The minimum is zero points.
⃝A coupled PTSM is a model where all parameters are known
⃝A coupled PTSM encodes the correlation between individual dimen-
sions or joints
⃝Radial basis functions cannot be used to approximate any non-linear
function
⃝Radial basis functions in PTSMs model the movement phase
⃝The bandwidth h parameter in radial basis functions defines the sup-
port or width of the Gaussians
⃝The integral over the product of the two dependent Gaussian distribu-
tions, i.e., N(x|Sy,σ2) N(y|µ,Σ) dy, cannot be solved analytically
⃝If the number of basis functions in PTSMs is increased, the model
complexity increases
⃝PTSMs can be used to predict unobserved dimensions from exploiting
the correlation of multi-dimensional systems

joint distribution over p(τ,θ) and by applying the Marginal rule. Clearly mark
