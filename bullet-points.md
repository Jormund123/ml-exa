1. Lecture 01 - Definition of ML
   ML is the science of fitting mathematical models to the data. It is to run complex algorithms on exemplary data to adjust parameters of other computer algorithms (models) so that they can perform cognitive tasks such as prediction, classification, clustering, etc.

It has 3 ingredients:
Data - observations
Fitting Algorithm - Optimization
Model - Parameterized Function

The goal is not to only fit the training data but to generalize to unseen data.

Loss function quanitfies how poorly a model fits the data. The smaller the loss the better the fit. It's goal is to convert the vague goal of "fitting a model" into a precise optimization problem.
