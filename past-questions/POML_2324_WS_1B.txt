Task 1
a) What is machine learning? And why is it useful?
b) What is a Loss function (or an objective function) and for what is it used in machine learning?
Task 2)
a) joint probability for i.i.d.
b) Log likelihood with respect to theta
c) ML - estimatar
d) MAP- estimator
Task 3) Bayesian inference
a) b) c) what is the posterior predictive distribution ? Definition or mathematical formulation
What is a conjugate distribution?
What are problems during Bayesian Inference?
d) Bayes Theorem
4) convex approximation
x^ = argmin_x SUM euclidean distance(x_j - x)
a) what would be way to minimize this problem?
b) Close form for w^
c) Interpretation for w
5) Kernel trick
a) b) what is the kernel trick?
Why is it interesting for machine learning?
6) SVM
a) b) c) write down the dual form of L_2 SVM?
What is a way to solve is?
What are the solutions for w and b?
7) Gaussian Processes
a) b) when we have input y that is not 0, how can we still solve (exercise sheet)
What could be a loss function for this? How could you derive a solution for this non-convex
loss function? Write down a way to solve this.
