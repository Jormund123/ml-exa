lecture 01
a first glimpse at machine learning . . .
artificial intelligence (AI) is a technical discipline that aims at building
cognitive machines
⇔ AI is concerned with computer algorithms and systems that can see,
hear, read, write, make plans, guide robots, . . .
machine learning (ML) is an important branch of artificial intelligence
this lecture provides a first rough overview of the what, why, and how
of machine learning
in passing, we already encounter some of the terminology commonly
used in the field

and the machine learning pipeline
we also have a first look at the different stages involved in training
a computational intelligence system to perform cognitive tasks
in short, we look at what people call the machine learning pipeline
and emphasize some of its general aspects we must be aware of

summary
4 / 69
what is machine learning ?
5 / 69
machine learning is the science of
fitting mathematical models to data
⇕
machine learning is to run computer algorithms
on exemplary data to adjust the parameters of
other computer algorithms (⇔ models) so that
these become able to perform cognitive tasks
6 / 69
the above definition deliberately demystifies the notion of ML
indeed, dramatic progress over the past decade has caused
considerable public interest in ML but accounts in the media
are usually horribly ignorant and hand-wavy
however, to make sense of our definition, we need to answer
two obvious follow up questions, namely
1) what are data ?
2) what are mathematical models ?
7 / 69
definitions of the concept of data can be surprisingly multi-faceted
and may range from more philosophical to more technical aspects
for instance, we may say that . . .
8 / 69
philosophically, data are known facts that
can be recorded, stored, and retrieved
and have an implicit “meaning”
technically, data are collections of (numerical)
values that result from measurements, surveys,
or similar procedures and can be processed by
computers
9 / 69
we also distinguish
structured data
⇔ data which easily fit into spreadsheets or relational data bases
⇔ data which naturally allow for organizing, searching, or hashing
⇔ data which can be represented in form of elementary data types
unstructured data
⇔ data such as texts, speech recordings, images, videos, . . .
⇔ data whose automatic analysis poses challenges
meta-data
⇔ data which carry additional information about other data
tags or labels, time when- and location where a picture was taken, captions, text annotations, . . .
10 / 69
in this course, our focus will be on ML algorithms and their underlying
mathematical principles rather than on ML system engineering
⇔ we will study algorithms that process numerical values or data points
in order to automatically determine their “meaning”
(in doing so, we will assume a rather mathematical view on “meaning”)
speaking about mathematics . . .
11 / 69
mathematical models are formal descriptions
of certain aspects of the observable world
⇕
mathematical models provide logical or structural
characterizations of principles, states, or dynamics
of the observable world and thus allow for making
(informed) predictions or decisions
12 / 69
note
mathematical models are typically but coarse abstractions
of very complex phenomena whose minute details may be
too complicated for a formal description
All models are wrong, but some are useful.

OK, but isn’t machine learning all about neural networks and such ???

question

answer
well, neural networks are nothing but very general mathematical models
14 / 69
one more thing . . .
15 / 69
there are three major ML paradigms
supervised learning
unsupervised learning
reinforcement learning
this course will focus on the first two

16 / 69
why do we use machine learning ?
17 / 69
model fitting allows us to make sense of data or to generalize
from known observations to new ones
⇔ we typically use machine learning to solve problems such as
regression
classification / pattern recognition
density estimation / data clustering
.
.
.
simplification / surrogate modeling
(multi-modal) content generation
18 / 69
(didactic) examples
19 / 69
regression
x
y
given data
D =


xj
, yj
n
j=1
where xj
, yj ∈ R, we may have reason
to believe that the yj depend on the xj
20 / 69
x
y
we may model this dependency
using a function
f : R → R
which (approximately) maps the independent variables or
predictors xj
to the dependent variables or outcomes yj
yj ≈ f

xj

21 / 69
x
y
the problem is that there are
infinitely many functions f
⇒ we “somehow” need to narrow down our choices of f
⇔ we “somehow” have to hypothesize a suitable model
22 / 69
x
y
here, we hypothesize that
the family of functions
f

x | a, b

= x
a
· sin
b · x

with parameters a, b ∈ R may provide an appropriate model of the data in D
⇒ our model fitting task is to determine optimal parameters a and b of f

x | a, b

⇔ we need to determine which choice of a and b best matches f

x | a, b

to D
23 / 69
x
y
the next problem is that there are
infinitely many choices for a and b
⇔ our hypothesis class is infinitely large
⇔ we cannot test every conceivable choice of
parameters to determine the optimal ones
⇒ we require smarter model fitting algorithms
24 / 69
x
y
indeed, using (simple) statistical
optimization techniques, we find
that f

x | a, b

with
a = 1.10
b = 1.99
characterizes our data very well
25 / 69
principle of machine learning
we may regress anything onto everything
however, when dealing with data such as
D =


"when I came home, my", "dog"
,

"I came home, my dog", "was"
,

"came home, my dog was", "already"
,

"home, my dog was already", "waiting"
, . . .
we will obviously have to work with very, very sophisticated models . . .
26 / 69
classification / pattern recognition
x1
given annotated data
x2
D =


xj
, yj
n
j=1
where the data points xj ∈ R
2 come from
two classes Ω1 or Ω2 and the annotations
yj =

+1 if xj ∈ Ω1
−1 if xj ∈ Ω2
are label values that indicate class membership, . . .
27 / 69
x1
we may want to train a classifier
x2
f : R
2 →

−1, +1
	
which (approximately) maps the
given data points to their labels
yj ≈ f

xj

28 / 69
x1
again, the common approach is to
x2
1) hypothesize a suitable model
2) use statistical optimization to
adjust the model parameters
such that the model fits the
given data
29 / 69
density estimation
x
given data
D =

xj
	n
j=1
where xj ∈ R, we might wonder
how these data are distributed
⇔ we are interested in a probability density function
f : R →

0, 1

that characterizes the distribution of the given data
30 / 69
x
again, we commonly
1) make (reasonable) modeling
assumptions
2) apply statistical optimization
to estimate parameters such
that our model best matches
the data
31 / 69
principle of machine learning
it may sound crazy, but nowadays (since ∼2015) density estimation is by far
the most important machine learning task
this is because all modern generative AI is at its heart based on (variants of)
fitted density models
32 / 69
clustering
x1
given data
x2
D =

xj
	n
j=1
where xj ∈ R
2
, we might wonder if
these data contain any structures,
subgroups, or clusters
for instance, if we have reason to suppose
there are k clusters, we look for a function
f : R
2 →

1, 2, . . . , k
	
which assigns data points to cluster labels
33 / 69
x1
again, the common approach is to
x2
1) hypothesize a suitable model
2) use statistical optimization to
adjust the model parameters
such that the model fits the
data
34 / 69
note
regression and classification are common examples of supervised learning problems
x1
x2
⇔ given data consists of pairs (xj
, yj) of observations xj
and corresponding targets yj
such pairs explicitly encode (certain) structures within
the universe of all possible observations
35 / 69
regression and classification are supervised learning problems
x1
x2
⇒ the task is to learn an abstract representation
of these structures
⇔ the task is to learn to replicate and generalize
known structures
36 / 69
note
density estimation and clustering are unsupervised learning problems
x1
x2
⇔ given data consists of observations xj only
information as to possible structures among
these observations is implicit a best
37 / 69
density estimation and clustering are unsupervised learning problems
x1
x2
⇒ the task is to identify (any) possible structures
⇔ the task is to make implicit information explicit
38 / 69
question
OK, but now for real: why do we fit models ?
39 / 69
question
OK, but now for real: why do we fit models ?
answer
good models will allow us to automatically
compress information, generalize given examples, reason about cause
and effect, make predictions, decisions and plans, generate content . . .
⇔ good models will allow us to implement cognitive capabilities on computers

how do we do machine learning ?
44 / 69
given everything we said so far, there remain three fundamental questions
1) how do we chose models ?
2) how do we fit them to data ?
3) what do we need to be aware of when we do this ?
alas, they are way too far reaching to be answered in an introductory lecture
they are what this course is all about and we shall study them exhaustively
for now, we note . . .
45 / 69
principles of machine learning
mathematically, machine learning involves
geometry and linear algebra
probability theory and statistics
calculus and optimization techniques
.
.
.
computer scientifically, machine learning involves
systems for storing, curating, accessing, and processing data
efficient and robust implementations of model fitting algorithms
speaking of systems . . .

question
wait a minute, why are there two different pipelines ?
answer
there might be even more such pipelines, because . . .
50 / 69
note
to a certain extent, machine learning is an art rather than a science
or, stated less defiantly, machine learning is still a young discipline
⇒ ways of talking about aspects of machine learning are not as fixed
as the nomenclature or terminology of more established sciences
⇔ authors (of textbooks, papers, . . . ), experts, and practitioners still
use different terminology to refer to basically the same ideas . . .
this is unfortunate, but we must live with it
51 / 69
for example
some talk about the hypothesis set, others use the term model family
some talk about the final hypothesis, others use the term fitted model
52 / 69
principle of machine learning
training a computational intelligence system to automatically
perform (difficult) cognitive tasks is a process
this process commonly involves several consecutive stages
problem specification
data collection
data pre-progressing
model selection
model fitting
model evaluation
model application
data collection data preprocessing
model selection
model fitting
model evaluation
application data model application
application problem
ML pipeline
53 / 69
problem specification
first of all, we need to clarify what application problem
we want to solve by means of machine learning
do we intend to recognize cats and dogs in images ?
do we want to predict the likely yield of a crop based
on nutrient measurements and weather data ?
.
.

problem specification / data collection
first of all, we need to clarify what application problem
we want to solve by means of machine learning
do we intend to recognize cats and dogs in images ?
do we want to predict the likely yield of a crop based
on nutrient measurements and weather data ?
.
.
.
once the goal is clear, we require corresponding data
which we record ourselves, obtain from collaborators, find on the Web, . . .
54 / 69
note
sometimes, these two initial stages are reversed
⇔ we might have data and need machine learning to make sense of it
say, we are given a humongous set of high dimensional data points
which overwhelms our human senses and cognitive capabilities . . .
we may then want to use machine learning for knowledge discovery
⇔ we may want to automatically determine if the data contains patterns,
correlations, or cause and effect relations which we should know about
55 / 69
data pre-processing
turning raw data into training data may require pre-processing such as
data cleansing
⇔ removal of outliers, incomplete- or faulty data points, etc.
data labeling
⇔ (manual) categorization or annotation of given observations
feature extraction
⇔ transformation of observations into more abstract representations
normalization
⇔ transformation of representations into “manageable” numerical ranges
56 / 69
data labeling can be easy but is typically cumbersome
for instance, for some scenarios, it may suffice to store pictures of cats
and dogs in folders called “Cats” and “Dogs” but other scenarios might
require us to carefully indicate which pixels in an image belong to a cat
or to a dog . . .
nowadays, we can of course get assistance from foundation models but
must trust that they work reliably . . .
annotated data is incredibly valuable
data which have been (reliably) sorted or categorized or augmented with
additional information (meta data) by human experts or AIs can make or
break success of machine learning algorithms
57 / 69
feature extraction either requires background knowledge . . .
for instance, observations of body heights and weights of people can be
turned into body mass indices which are known predictors for diseases
. . . or can be accomplished automatically
given enough data, deep neural networks can learn useful representations
58 / 69
model selection
given a sample of problem specific data, we need to decide for
a “suitable” model class
⇔ we need to specify a family of mathematical functions which we
expect to be able to solve the problem at hand
common models will be studied later on
59 / 69
model fitting / training
having specified a model class, we need to determine or learn
“appropriate” model parameters
⇔ we need to run optimization algorithms to fit the (mathematical)
model to the given data
model training will be studied later on
60 / 69
model evaluation / testing
having fitted a model to the data, we should evaluate if it can generalize
⇔ we should test whether the model only explains the training data or also
works well on previously unseen test data
61 / 69
principles of machine learning
training data must be representative
⇔ they should reflect all relevant aspects of what is to be learned
(to see what happens if they aren’t, consider the 2015 Google photos incident)
test data must be independent from the training data
⇔ when working rigorously, we really must insist on Dtrn ∩ Dtst = ∅
in practice, these two principles are ridiculously important, because . . .
62 / 69
principles of machine learning
good performance of a model on its training data means nothing
what really counts are generalization / extrapolation capabilities of a trained model
⇔ what really counts is how well a trained model performs on independent test data
we must avoid the beginner’s mistake of improper model testing
⇔ any statement we make about the performance of a machine learning system must
be derived from test data which is independent of training data
63 / 69
note
however, things have begun to change . . .
modern foundation models and genAI make the above look old school
nowadays, cutting edge models are trained with trillions of data points
for these, traditional concerns regarding over-fitting don’t hold anymore
alas, as of today, only a few players across the world are technically able
(⇔ have the compute infrastructure) to work in these settings
⇒ unless you are with OpenAI, DeepMind, . . . the above is still important
64 / 69
model refinement
if a trained model or system does not perform well (enough),
we may need to
consider additional / better training data
reconsider our model class / hypothesis set
.
.
.
⇔ we may need to iterate through (parts of) the pipeline again
w.r.t. foundation models, this is also called model fine-tuning
65 / 69
model application
if a trained model or system performs and generalizes well,
we can apply it in practice
⇔ we can feed new data from our application domain into the
system and work with the predictions it generates
66 / 69
summary
67 / 69
we now know that
machine learning is the science of fitting models to data
machine learning terminology is often still rather fuzzy
machine learning is not an end in itself but a tool(box)
for problem solving in data analysis and synthesis
a machine learning pipeline involves different stages such as
data pre-processing, model selection, model fitting, model evaluation
