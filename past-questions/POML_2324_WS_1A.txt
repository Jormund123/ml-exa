Exercise 1 (5+5 P)
a) What is Machine Learning?
b) What is a loss function / objective function? Describe their roles in Machine Learning?
Exercise 2 Likelihood (2+2+3+3 P)
a) Given an sample D= {x1,...,xn}, express their joint probability: P(□|θ) = p(x1,...,xn|Θ) =
solution: n
j=1 p(xj|θ)
b) Using the above, write down the log-likelihood function L(θ) =
solution: As the above is the Likelihood function, it follows that Lθ) = log L(θ) =n
j=1 log p(xj|θ)
c) Write down a maximum likelihood estimator of θ
ΘML =
solution: argmax
θ
p(D|θ)
d) Write down a maximum a-posteriori estimator for θ
ΘMAP =
solution: argmax
p(θ|D)
θ
Exercise 3 Bayesian data analysis (2+2+2+4 P)
Given a distribution p(D|θ).
a) Write down Bayes’ theorem to compute the posterior.
solution: p(θ|D) = p(D|θ) p(θ)
p(D)
b) Explain the notion of conjugate priors.
c) Explain the notion of posterior predictive distribution and write down the posterior predictive distribution
based on the notation in subtask a).
d) Reason about why Bayesian inference is often very hard in practise. Give at least one example.
Exercise 4 Simple convex optimisation (4+4+2 P)
Considerˆ
x= argmin
x
||xj−x||2
a) How would you solve this?
b) Explicitly computeˆ
x
ˆ
x=
c) What does your computation in b) imply?

Exercise 5 The Kernel trick (5+5 P)
a) What’s the kernel trick?
b) Where and how is the Kernel trick used in Machine Learning?
Exercise 6 Support Vector Machines (5+5+5 P)
a) Write down the (formal) Dual Problem of L2 SVM training.
b) How would you solve this problem?
c) Using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions: Once you have solved the L2 training problem, how can w
and bbe computed?
w=
b=
Exercise 7 Gaussian processes (5+10 P)
Given x= input, y= output, N(0,C(Θ))
a) We often model with N(0,C(θ)), but you cannot always assume a zero-mean. How do you work with
arbitrary y?
b) How can you get the optimal parameters for C(Θ)? The explanation should include the kernel for C(Θ)
as well as other explicit formulas.
How would you solve the optimisation problem, considering it is not convex?
